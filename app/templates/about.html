            By creating short pieces of code, you can easily test out new ideas and techniques without committing to a larger project. 
            Saving these snippets allows you to refer back to them later and use them as a reference for future projects. 
            Sharing these pieces of code with others can also be beneficial because it allows for 
            feedback and collaboration, leading to even better results.

            This helps to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the changes that have been 
            made to your code over time and can easily refer back to specific versions if needed. 
            By keeping track of the version and date of your code, you can also more easily 
            collaborate with other developers and share your work.
